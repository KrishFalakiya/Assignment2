            <p> Not tryna be indie<br>
                Not tryna be cool<br>
                Just tryna be in this<br>
                Tell me, are you too?<br>
                Can you feel where the wind is?<br>
                Can you feel it through<br>
                All of the windows<br>
                Inside this room?<br>
                'Cause I wanna touch you, baby<br>
                And I wanna feel you too<br>
                I wanna see the sun rise on your sins<br>
                Just me and you<br>
                Light it up, on the run<br>
                Let's make love tonight<br>
                Make it up, fall in love, try<br>
                (Baby, I'm right here)<br>
                <span class="yelling">But you'll never be alone<br>
                I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
                I'll be with you from dusk till dawn</span><br>
                <span class="happy">Baby, I'm right here</span><br>
                I'll hold you when things go wrong<br>
                I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
                I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
                <span class="happy">Baby, I'm right here</span><br>
                I'll be with you from dusk till dawn<br>
                <span class="happy">Baby, I'm right here</span><br>
                We were shut like a jacket<br>
                So do your zip<br>
                We would roll down the rapids<br>
                To find a wave that fits<br>
                Can you feel where the wind is?<br>
                Can you feel it through<br>
                All of the windows<br>
                Inside this room?<br>
                'Cause I wanna touch you, baby<br>
                I wanna feel you too<br>
                I wanna see the sun rise on your sins<br>
                Just me and you<br>
                Light it up, on the run<br>
                Let's make love tonight<br>

                Girl, give love to your body<br>
                It's only you that can stop it<br>
